# SGL2
SGL2 is a complete rewrite of the Seagull PHP framework for PHP5.

## Installation
An easy way to get the code up and running is to checkout `sgl2` and `sgl2_demo_app` on the same level in your web directory.  You can place the libs in different locations, just modify `sgl2_demo_app/www/index.ph`p accordingly for the includes.

## Requirements
Currently the code is working fine in >= PHP 5.2.x.  You'll need to have `HTML_Template_Flexy` installed as a PEAR library, ie, in your include path.
