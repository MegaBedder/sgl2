# SGL2
SGL2 is a complete rewrite of the Seagull PHP framework for PHP5.

## Installation
The easiest way to get the code up and running is to checkout `sgl2` and `sgl2_demo_app` into one directory in your web root folder.  You can alternatively place the libs in different locations, you would just modify `sgl2_demo_app/www/index.php` accordingly for the includes.

## Requirements
Currently the code is working fine in >= PHP 5.2.6.
